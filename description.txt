This mod adds simple bonuses to the Angler Armor Set. These bonuses are the ability to add more fishing lines in Fishing Rods and the ability to have a chance to double or triple the catch.

Fishing Line number is configurable. Double catch chance is configurable. Triple catch chance is also configurable.

Triple catch chance will only be computed when the check for double catch chance is successful.

Each of the features can be disabled by setting their values to 0.
